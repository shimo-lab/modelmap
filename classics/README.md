## Shimodaira (1993)

This paper proposed two ideas: confidence sets of models and model maps. The concept of confidence sets was later widely adopted in the field of molecular phylogenetics, particularly through [Shimodaira and Hasegawa (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026201). In contrast, the idea of model maps has received little attention or use.

Theorem 2 shows that the variance of the difference of log-likelihoods approximates the Jeffreys divergence between two models. Figures 17 and 18 show the model map of linear regression for the Boston housing data and the hierarchical clustering of the models.

This work defines model maps based on log-likelihood vectors and presents examples from regression analysis and molecular phylogenetics. Part of this paper was later published as [Shimodaira (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1081/STA-100105696).

Section 2 describes the model map based on log-likelihood vectors. Figure 3 shows the model map of linear regression for the Boston housing data, and Figure 6 shows the model map of molecular phylogenetic tree topologies.
